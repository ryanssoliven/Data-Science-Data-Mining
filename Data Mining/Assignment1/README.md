Used five different classifications techniques that can find a model to map each attribute to either the Kecimen class, or the Besni class, so that we can use this model on new records to assign them to one of the classes as accurately as possible. 

Classification Techniques Used: K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier, Artificial Neural Netowrks Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier, Logistic Regression Classifier

For each classifier, we first standardize the data, to get the best accuracy score. We then split the data, to train the classifier, and later to test the classifier. 
We will use functions that provide a classification report, the accuracy, and a confusion matrix to compare the results of each classification technique.
The dataset used was taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and is the Raisin Dataset
